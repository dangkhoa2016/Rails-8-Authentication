  <h5>Add the Devise Gem</h5>
  <p>
    Follow the official Devise documentation for installation instructions:<br />
    <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise GitHub Repository</a>
  </p>
  <h4>Example: Using the <code>Validatable</code> Module</h4>
  <p>
    The <code>Validatable</code> module provides built-in email and password validations, such as format and length checks. By default, this module is included in Devise, so you don't need to add it manually unless you want to
    customize the validation logic.
  </p>
  <p>To explicitly enable it, add the following to your model:</p>
  <code>
  <pre>
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  devise :validatable
end</pre>
  </code>
  <h4>Customizing Devise Views</h4>
  <p>Devise provides views for handling actions like sign-in, sign-up, and password resets. You can generate these views and customize them by running:</p>
  <code>
    <pre>rails generate devise:views</pre>
  </code>
  <p>This command will copy Devise's default views to your app under the <code>views/devise/</code> directory, where you can modify them as needed.</p>
